  -euses-2.5.5-r1.ebuild, +euses-2.5.9-r1.ebuild:
  overlay patches adjusted to new version

  04 May 2010; Viktor Lazarev <taurus101v@gmail.com> euses-2.5.5-r1.ebuild:
  repoman payment

2.5.5 - 2008-08-25
	Few bugfixes: Close file descriptors after use. Adhere to custom
	LDFLAGS in Makefile (bug #237070).

2.5.4 - 2006-12-08
	Minor enhancements (changed snprintf to strncpy here and there).

2.5.3 - 2006-11-24
	Fixed build / use problems on BSD (gentoo bug #140321)..

2.5.2 - 2006-11-22
	Corrected some major errors in the getportdir() code. This will help
	euses not segfault so much. Also built in a sanity check: if PORTDIR
	is not a directory, it defaults to /usr/portage.

2.5.1 - 2006-11-20
	Fixed most of the problems for Gentoo/Alt as reported in bug #140321.

	Improved check for lines that are comments.

2.5.0 - 2006-11-18
	Implemented the beginnings of a --pedantic mode.
	
	Changed a lot of the command line options around, notably removing
	--local and --global in favour of printing the filename in the output
	through the --verbose option. Implemented this because the number of
	*.desc files has grown enormously: with this release everything in
	PORTDIR/profiles/{,desc/}*.desc can be searched as well through the
	--allfiles -A option. Without -A, only use.{,local.}desc are searched.

	I also added a $(which bash) check to Makefile.in to find the bash
	executable whereever it happens to be, /usr/local/bin/bash for
	example.

	I masked profiles.desc as it doesn't use a proper format and since I
	started globbing for all {,desc/}*.desc files.
	
	In other news, I removed the PHP script. It's silly. :)

	Cleaned up the code a lot. It's reasonably legible now.

2.5.0_pre2 - 2006-02-02
	Added -S, --strip, which makes euses take output from emerge, like
	ipv6* -gtk -qt% (and even old-style <+flag>) and strips that annoying
	punctuation. Users can simply copy and paste what emerge says after
	something like `euses -cS` and euses will explain the USE flags
	without any need to remove all that fluff. I also made euses bail out
	in case of conflicting USE flags, like --strict with --ignorecase or
	--allfields, before it goes on the hunt for combinations that cannot,
	nay should not exist.

2.5.0_pre1 - 2006-02-01
	Added -L, --language to enable searching lang.desc and -A, --allfiles
	to enable searching all of use[.local].desc and lang.desc. Updated the
	man page and usage output to reflect that but didn't alter euses.php
	yet. CAREFUL: The -a, --all long option lost its meaning and was changed
	to --allfields.

2.4.3 - 2006-01-03
	Fixes a bug where a stale pkg string was printed inadvertently before
	a UD line.

2.4.2 - 2005-11-19
	Submitted as bug 113017 <http://bugs.gentoo.org/113017>.

2.4.2 - 2005-11-11
	Added -s, --strict option to match only complete fields (package,
	flag, description).

2.4.1 - 2005-11-07
	Changed -n, --noformat to -F, --format and changed the behaviour
	accordingly: the prefixes are now a true option as they should be.

2.4.0 - 2005-11-06
	Changed the code so that UD and ULD are only opened and closed once.

2.3.9 - 2005-11-01
	Fixed some formatting errors in the usage() output.
	Improved the PHP page to look up the euses version itself.

2.3.8 - 2005-10-28
	Fixed the issue where I had forgotten to reimplement -n, --noformat,
	and had no prefixes at all except for 'X', so that the PHP script was
	broken as well. 8-)
	Updated the PHP file with form options for the new search options.

2.3.7 - 2005-10-27
	Implemented -i, --ignorecase: case-insensitive search. Will still
	default to sensitive search as the user is expected to know the flag,
	not probe for a flag, even though -f, --flag is now implemented as
	well along with -d, --description and -a, --all and -p, --package.
	Which is nice...

2.3.6 - 2005-10-27
	Finally got ahead with the string search replacements... Now to
	implement them in said version. <-- Done
	Went on to implement only packages, only descriptions or full lines.
	Code is a lot cleaner now with just a couple of functions left.

2.3.5 - 2005-10-24
	Changed some of the externals quite a bit: I dropped the isatty()
	stuff and now just check for the -c option. *sigh of relief*
	Updated the man page.
	Promised to start checking for the NOCOLOR variable soon.
	Cleaned up the mess. ;)
	Changed versioning scheme to a.b.c.

2.3.* - <2005-10-24
	Replaced all the ugly strncat()s with sprintf()s.

2.3 - 2005-10-*
	lol - This one made it into Portage!
	As to all the previous versions, I never bothered to write a ChangeLog
	entry for any of them. *shrug*
