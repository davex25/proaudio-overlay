# Descrition:
#	it's basically a wrapper around ebuild which also is useful
# 	if you've just modified the ebuild a bit and won't want to
#	recompile the whole pkg
#	(the magic here is just to change the time of the pkg's WORKDIR)
# Usage:
#	same as just the ebuild command
# it's to best place a symlink into /usr/local/bin/ to run this script
# eg ln -s `pwd`/ebuild_debug  /usr/local/bin/

	# go to dirs down (get the root_path for the tree)
