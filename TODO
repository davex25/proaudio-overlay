I find that a SuperCollider 3 'svn' ebuild would be a great idea, not? Details can be found here:

http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/6

Also, it would be great to include some of its plugins in the overlay (freeverb, munger, rossler..), the two GUI servers SCUM and SwingOSC plus the some of the class library extensions, which are also on swiki. I can't write the ebuild, but I could give advice on how I would do it if I could :D
Anyone interested?
