# WARNING: all supported apps now uses lash the successor of ladcca.
# so if you have used ladcca before. Add lash -ladcca to your useflags
# in /etc/make.conf 
# You need to remove ladcca package and then install lash.
# reemerge (if already installed) vkeybd, jack-rack, museseq, etc.
# to use the lash libraries

# BIG FAT WARNING: these ebuilds are not supported by gentoo-devs
# and might break your system :)

This overlay is for music-production purposes
complete list of packages look in file

Most packages are not well tested but compile at least on x86
MOST packages provided uses keywords x86.

# (fst path/to/instrument.dll) 
emerge fst

# notes on snapshot (svn/cvs/whatever-ebuilds)
# we use standard gentoo ebuild scheme for snapshot ebuilds.
# So there will be no longer ebuilds named: foo-cvs-1.ebuild Instead
# they are named foo-9999.ebuild. e.g. to compile the latest rosegarden svn
# checkout you now have to do the following:

echo "media-sound/rosegarden **" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
emerge rosegarden

# If you get messages about *-cvs/svn "Blocked Packages" remove the
# blocked one and try again

lash.eclass:
-----------
I wrote an eclass which tries to convert all ladcca symbols to lash in
the source-code. So most ladcca-able programs can easily be converted.
Just look at lash.eclass for further information.

# changes
----------------
# read old_ChangeLog
# svn-log here:
http://svnweb.tuxfamily.org/log.php?repname=proaudio+%28ckpp%29&path=%2F&rev=0&sc=0&isdir=1

So I hope you enjoy those ebuilds and if you have own ebuilds and want to
contribute send them to: [evermind att tuxfamily dot org]
Also suggestion & critics are welcome!
