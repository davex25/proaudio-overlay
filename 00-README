Welcome Earthling!

# ABOUT:

This is the pro-audio gentoo overlay containing pro-audio software and libs
that are not in official portage.
The ebuilds come from different sources: some of them are written by gimpel,
lots of them are from evermind's superb pro-audio overlay which can be found
here: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-427211.html

# DISCLAIMER:

Parts of this overlay contain highly experimental software. USE WITH CARE!
Do NOT blame us or even worse the gentoo developers if using these ebuilds
causes your computer to explode, your cat violently attacs you, your girlfriend
tells you to STFUAPOA or god knows what else.


# USAGE:

A: using layman

  install layman
  $ emerge -av layman
  include layman to make.conf
  $ echo "source /usr/portage/local/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf
  fetch the overlaylist and add pro-audio overlay
  $ layman -f -a pro-audio

B: using SVN directly

1.) first checkout the overlay with

  $ cd /usr/local/overlays
  $ svn co svn://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/proaudio/proaudio
  
  Note that you maybe have to create the dir /usr/local/overlays first
  
2.) add the overlay to /etc/make.conf. For info on how to do so, 
  please refer to
  http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Installing_3rd_Party_Ebuilds

3.) to update the overlay:

  $ cd /usr/local/overlays/proaudio
  $ svn up


# TROUBLE?

From time to time it might happen that you get things like "digest verification failed" or similar.
This is because someone forgot to re-digest the ebuild after commiting changes. Just cd in the
directory of the ebuild ("foo" in the example) and do:

  $ ebuild foo.ebuild digest
