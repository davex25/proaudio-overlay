  +distrho-20120518.ebuild, +files/distrho-20120518-verbose-makefiles.patch,
  +metadata.xml:
  Initial import. Attempted to merge my ebuild and the one created thanks to
  Tina Cochet. Added patch for verbose makefiles and tried to sed out the
  forced compiler flags and stripping. premake dep forced to 3.7 as this is
  the only premake version that I could get distrho to build with, see bug
  #435744. Big source package so no doubt needs more review/testing.
