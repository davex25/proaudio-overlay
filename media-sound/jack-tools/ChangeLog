  -files/fix_ftbfs_ld_as_needed.patch, -files/fix_ftbfs_with_printf.patch:
  adjust SRC_URI to pull in tarball and patches from ubuntu repo, cleanup
  ebuild. remove patches from filesdir which are included in SRC_URI.
  remove live ebuild because there are missing files which are in another
  repo upstream called c-common, a new package should be created for that.
