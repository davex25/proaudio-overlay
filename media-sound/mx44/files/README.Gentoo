mx44 for Gentoo
---------------

The shell-script for Debian was added that creates the directory ~/.mx44 if it doesn't exist,
and copies the default patches to it. This way, a new user can use the standard
patches and still save changes.

Thanks to  -- Willem van Engen <wvengen+demudi@stack.nl>, he made the script.
