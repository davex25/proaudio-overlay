1. # get a account at tuxfamily.org
  You need to get a account at http://tuxfamily.org 
  (they provide the svn-repo and Webspace)

1.1 # request  svn write access
  Just write to Thomas or me (Frieder) gain
  write accesss


2.0 # basic subversion commands
  You've to know how to checkout/commit the overlay repository:
  So here some basics:

2.1 # checkout the overlay
  # also read 4.0 and 4.1 before doing this step
  svn co svn+ssh://<your_tuxfamily_login>@svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/proaudio/proaudio
  # or
  svn co --username <your_tuxfamily_login> svn+ssh://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/proaudio/proaudio

  # for me the subversion server asked me three times before 
  # accepting my password

2.2 # howto add a new ebuild to the tree   
  # go inside your repository checkout eg into media-sound
  cd ~/path/to/proaudio/media-sound
  mkdir foo
  cd foo
  vi foo-0.1.ebuild
  ebuild foo-0.1.ebuild digest
  cd ..
  svn st|status	# see the changes made to local repository
		# ? - means not added to the tree (svn ci ignore those files)
		# A - means freshly added to the overlay but not commited
		# C - means conflicting with a previous revision
		# 	to avoid this: do a "svn up" to make sure
		# 	you edit the latest version of a ebuild
		# D - means files gets deleted with next commit
		# U - means updated

  svn add foo 	# adds directory foo recurively  to the overlay (only local) 
  svn ci|commit	# until commit nothing changes in the repository on the 
   		# svn-server
  svn ci -m 'what this commit changes' # you could add just in one line what
  		# your commit actually changes instead of using a vim/nano/...



2.3 # just change a ebuild 
  # 1. close the your prefered editor 
  # 2. redigest your ebuild
  svn st	# displays the changes made to the overlay 
  svn ci	# commit changes

2.4 # delete some files/directories
  svn del foo 	# this changes are just local on your copy of the repository
		# sometimes svn don't allow to delete things so try with --force
  svn ci	# commit changes


2.5 # move files around (e.g bumping) (if former version is obsolete)
  svn mv foo/foobar-123.ebuild foo/foobar-124.ebuild
  # if not obsolete you could also bump with svn cp
  svn cp foo/foobar-123.ebuild foo/foobar-124.ebuild
  # or of course with just 'cp' and adding new files afterwards with
  svn add foo/foobar-124.ebuild
  
  # make sure to adjust dependencies (DEPEND RDEPEND) if needed
  # If you've trouble with the right syntax look at point 3.1
  # Make sure that if you're bumping to redigest and also add 
  # the digest of the ebuild to the overlay
  # for above example:
  svn st # gives you this
  ?	files/digest-foobar-124
  <snip>
  # so the following step is also needed before a commit
  svn add files/digest-foobar-124
  # know svn st shows
  A	files/digest-foobar-124
  <snip>
  # ready for commiting


2.6 # reverse your local changes to an ebuild/folder
  svn revert path/to/file_which_you_want_to_revert # revert a file
  svn revert -R foo/	# revert recursively all changes made in foo/


2.7 # display the subversion log
  svn log 	# diplays the logfile


2.8 # edit the logfile if your message was not correct 
  # and you feel you should correct it
  svn propedit svn:log --revprop -r <revision-number>


2.9 # change the repository server location (JFYI) :)
  svn switch --relocate svn://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/ckpp/proaudio svn://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/proaudio/proaudio/


2.10 # generate patches for review something 
  # eg. local modification to last checkout
  svn diff foo/foobar-123.ebuild
  # or a diff to a specific revision
  svn diff -r 3 foo/foobar-123.ebuild


2.11 # login automatically to svn-server
  # put your id_rsa.pub key to the root of your 
  # (generate one if you don't have already one)
    --> ssh-keygen -t rsa
  # ftp-account at ftp.tuxfamily.org you can use ncftpput (emerge ncftp)
  # or any other ftp-client
  ncftpput -u <your_tuxfamily_login> -C ftp.tuxfamily.org ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ssh_keys


3. # our policy/rules

3.1 # read the ebuild documentation at
   http://proaudio.tuxfamily.org/wiki/index.php?title=Contribute_ebuilds 
   # and the also the gentoo ebuild manuals :)


3.1.1 # run svn up
  # to avoid double-work always work on the latest checkout with
  svn up


3.2 # ebuild license
  # All commited ebuild must have to be licensed gnu gpl v2
  # so contribute with proper header eg.
  
  # Copyright 1999-2007 Gentoo Foundation
  # Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
  # $Header: $


3.3 # check your ebuilds if they are acutally working
  # put the correct archs into KEYWORDS (I prefer mostly stable keywords but if
  # the new version of a ebuild couldn't break things do ~arch or -*)
  # ALL snapshot ebuilds Have -* as useflag and use the scheme:
  foobar-9999.ebuild


3.4 # redigest your ebuild
  # try to assure that you've redigest your ebuild before commit
  # and also make sure that there are no temporary files laying around
  # which cause digest failures for other people


3.5 # update the package list
  # please execute both scripts before commiting some bumped or new
  # ebuilds to the overlay.
  # Execute this scripts inside the overlay root. They modify two
  # files inside the overlay.
  ./prepare_tree	# checks for some digest breakage and
  			# generates 00-PACKAGES-LIST
  # and generate with 
  ./generate-detailed-packages-list # generate 00-DETAILED-PACKAGES-LIST


3.6 # add missing apps to 00-TODO
  # if you've found an nice to have app which is not already in the overlay
  # and you think there should be a ebuild but hav no time and before
  # you forget about it add a entry about there.
  # For every missing app with have a  "block" which needs some details
  
  # NAME: 
  EBUID_STATE: none/working/
  DEVELOPER: <maybe your name>
  DESCR: <info about the app>
  HOMEPAGE: http://foo.bar

  # If you've added a ebuild that's listing in the todo file
  # please remove its entry

3.7 # 00-README 00-OVERLAY-INFO
  # this both files gives a bit of introduction to the overlay
  # should be updated (feel free to edit them)


3.8 # change the rules/scripts/ebuilds/readme's/...
  # you're free to change other peoples ebuilds if you could improve/fix
  # You could also fix/enhance all scripts at point 3.5


3.9 # hope this are not to much rules


4.0 # overlay hierarchy:
  # for absolute experimental ebuild we have a dev branch
  # in this branch ebuilds could really be broken.
  # This is also a place where we can collaborate in developing new
  # ebuilds (add this overlay also to your other overlays see 4.1)
  # If you put a new ebuild here and the category is missing create it.
  svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/proaudio/trunk/overlays/proaudio-dev
  
  # this is our main overlay in which only "working" ebuilds should
  # be placed
  svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/proaudio/trunk/overlays/proaudio


4.1 # example proaudio / proaudio-dev overlays setup
  # this is how I've organized the proaudio overlay on my box
  # I've placed the svn checkout in  ~/svn-checkouts/
  cd  ~/svn-checkouts/
  # fetch the tree as developer 
  svn co svn+ssh://<your_tuxfamily_login>@svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/proaudio/proaudio
  # edit /etc/make.conf and add both overlays proaudio and proaudio-dev
  PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/home/evermind/svn-checkouts/proaudio/trunk/overlays/proaudio /home/evermind/svn-checkouts/proaudio/trunk/overlays/proaudio-dev <other overlays>"


5.0 # feel free to ask
  # if you've questions problems you could always ask on the ml
  # Communication is everything 


6.0 # testing ebuilds on different archs
  # ebuild which are not already tested on a specific arch 
  # could be found with the below script which is
  # inside the proaudio overlay root
  ./check_ebuild_unstable-untested arch # eg ./check_ebuild_unstable-untested amd64
  # above script reveals all ebuilds without 'arch'
  # --> this ebuilds needs testing 
  # so rekeyword if it builds AND works and check it into the svn repository
  # (some ebuilds might only work on the given arch)
